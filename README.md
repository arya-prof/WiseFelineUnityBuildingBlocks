# WiseFelineUnityBuildingBlocks
This repository contains a collection of actions and considerations for the unity version of the wise feline utility AI and influence maps plugin.

The code here doesn't compile without you purchasing either the Lite or Ultimate version of [our Utility AI and influence maps library for Unity](https://www.nooparmygames.com/products/wise-feline-utility-ai-for-unity/).

Here is a list of considerations and actions which allow you to do both rapid prototyping and teach you how to build your own actions and considerations for Utility AI.
Each item says if it needs the ultimate version.
